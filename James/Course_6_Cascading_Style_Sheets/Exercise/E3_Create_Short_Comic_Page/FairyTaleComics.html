    <h5>WISDOM HAT</h5>

    <p>
        Once upon a time, there was a very old king who wanted to pass the throne to his only son who was somewhat stupid.
        <br>
        But the courtiers and the people opposed that idea. They suggested to the king that six months later he held a talent contest.
        <br>
        If the prince cannot prove his wisdom, he will not be crowned.
        <br><br>
        The king was very worried, could not think of a good way, so he sent the prince to see a witch. He said to the prince:
        <br><br>
        - You must give this to the witch. She is a magical person, if she eats your food, she will happily impart magic to you.
        <br><br>
        The prince remembered the king's words, he brought a lot of food, he ate it while walking, and he also gave his food to everyone he met on the road.
        <br>
        Finally the prince met an old woman, he brought the remaining dried fruit to her. The old woman took it, the prince asked, indeed she was the witch.
        <br>
        So the prince begged her to give him wisdom.
        <br><br>
        The witch said:
        <br><br>
        - I am glad to give you wisdom. But on condition that the king closes all schools, because schools give people knowledge, they will rob me of my witchcraft.
        <br><br>
        The prince hastily agreed.
        <br><br>
        The witch knitted the prince a hat of wisdom, when wearing that hat, everyone would become extremely intelligent.
        <br>
        The prince returned, told the story he had experienced, the king was overjoyed. They believe that the prince will definitely inherit the throne.
        <br><br>
        The day of the talent contest came, the people sent nine young men to give speeches with the prince.
        <br>
        Although it was very hot, the prince still wore that hat. He was a very successful speaker and was applauded by many people.
        <br><br>
        The prince's intelligence surprised everyone, and the hat he wore was also very strange.
        <br>
        Therefore, a smart person recommends, when giving a speech, to stand up straight and take off your hat to show respect for everyone.
        <br><br>
        This time the king had no way to refuse.
        <br>
        The second speaking contest begins.
        <br><br>
        The prince took off his hat of wisdom and spoke with a humiliating awkwardness.
        <br>
        Everyone laughed and forced the prince to lower the stage.
        <br><br>
        In the end, they chose one of the smartest of the nine young men to be king, the remaining eight were all ministers.
