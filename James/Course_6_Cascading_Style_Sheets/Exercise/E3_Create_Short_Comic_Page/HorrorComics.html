    <h5>HALLOWEEN DECORATION</h5>

    <p>
        In 2005, a Delaware woman was found hanged from a tree on the street near her residence.
        <br>
        It is worth mentioning that everyone saw this scene, but for many hours, no one called the police.
        <br>
        Turns out, when asked, many people assumed that this hanging woman was merely a decoration for Halloween.
