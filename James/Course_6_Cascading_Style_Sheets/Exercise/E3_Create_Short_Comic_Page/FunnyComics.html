    <h5>FORGETFUL WIFE</h5>

    <p>
        After eating, when she got in the car and went quite far, the wife
        <br>
        suddenly remembered that she forgot her glasses on the dining table.
        <br><br>
        On the way back to the shop, the husband always grumbled about his wife's forgetfulness.
        <br><br>
        Arriving at the old place, when the wife rushed in to find glasses, the husband told him to follow:
        <br>
        - Don't forget to bring me both my hat and umbrella!
    </p>
